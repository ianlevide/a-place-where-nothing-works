            LAYING IN THE DARK WITH EYES WIDE OPEN, YOU TURN OVER AND CHECK THE TIME ON YOUR PHONE.
            2:47AM.
            YOU'RE NOT SURE WHY, BUT SLEEPING SEEMS THE HARDEST WHEN THE WORLD IS SILENT.
            
            PUSH YOURSELF OUT OF BED, AND USE YOUR HANDS TO FOLLOW THE WALLS THROUGH YOUR PITCH BLACK ROOM UNTIL YOU FEEL A SWITCH.
            
            -click-
            -click-
            -click-
            
            THE SWITCH FLICKS, BUT THE LIGHTS DON'T SEEM TO WORK.
            
            -click-
            -click-
            -click-
            
            THE LIGHTS FLICK ON, AND ILLUMINATE YOUR ROOM. THERE ARE BOTTLES, LAUNDRY, AND DIRTY DISHES THROWN ALL AROUND THE ROOM.
            YOU SHOULD PROBABLY PICK IT UP AT SOME POINT.
            BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.
            
            YOU PLACE YOUR HAND ON THE DOORKNOB NEXT TO THE LIGHT SWITCH.
