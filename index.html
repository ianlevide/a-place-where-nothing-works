            LAYING IN THE DARK WITH EYES WIDE OPEN, YOU TURN OVER AND CHECK THE TIME ON YOUR PHONE.
            <br>
            2:47AM.
            <br>
            YOU'RE NOT SURE WHY, BUT SLEEPING SEEMS THE HARDEST WHEN THE WORLD IS SILENT.
            <br><br>
            PUSHING YOURSELF OUT OF BED, YOU USE YOUR HANDS TO FOLLOW A WALL THROUGH YOUR PITCH BLACK ROOM UNTIL YOU FEEL A SWITCH.
            <br><br>
            -click-
            -click-
            -click-
            <br><br>
            THE SWITCH FLICKS, BUT THE LIGHTS DON'T SEEM TO WORK.
            <br><br>
            -click-
            <br>
            -click-
            <br>
            -click-
            <br><br>
            THE LIGHTS FLICK ON, AND ILLUMINATE YOUR ROOM. THERE ARE BOTTLES, LAUNDRY, AND DIRTY DISHES THROWN ALL AROUND THE ROOM.
            <br>
            YOU SHOULD PROBABLY PICK IT UP AT SOME POINT.
            <br>
            BUT NOT RIGHT NOW.
            <br><br>
            YOU PLACE YOUR HAND ON THE DOORKNOB NEXT TO THE LIGHT SWITCH.
            <br>
